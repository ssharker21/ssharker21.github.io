33917,The Namesake,Jhumpa Lahiri,"Lahiri, Jhumpa",,"=""0618485228""","=""9780618485222""",4,4.02,Mariner,Paperback,304,2003,2003,2025/08/28,2025/08/28,,,read,"from a technical point of view, it's damn near perfect. difficult to believe that anyone can master the english language in their debut novel, but jhumpa lahiri does so. thought i spotted some faint parallels to kazuo ishiguro's style.<br/><br/>unfortunately, the story is not generalizable. if i had no knowledge of what the bengali-american experience was like, i would probably be annoyed by all the random bangla words and phrases. the author kinda just throws them in there. if i wasn't biased, i would knock off another star for this reason alone.<br/><br/>but the bengali-american experience is timeless. it has not changed in the 40 years since the events were depicted. very uncomfortable to read—whatever the opposite of escapism is.<br/><br/>next, nikhil's mother pmo. i don't know if it was jhumpa lahiri's intention to fetishize this perverse strain of anti-assimilation, but we really don't need to put this behavior on a pedestal. unfortunately, i see redditors and goodreaders thinking her behavior is really exotic or even endearing. fuck no, it's not cool.<br/><br/>nikhil is a great character. perhaps cope, but i see myself in him, and i certainly need to be more like him. if i were nitpicky, i would say that jhumpa lahiri's depiction of him is yet another example of ""women writing men."" nikhil is simply too cool and perfect to be real. thought i would only find this from colleen hoover or YA fantasy. but some other characters are complex enough.<br/><br/>finally, the setting feels like the back of my hand. jhumpa lahiri has an impressive, uncanny knowledge of the northeastern american experience: the amtrak feel coming home from school, the commuter lines in boston, etc. new york city is described extremely realistically as well. you can likely retrace every step every character takes in this novel.<br/><br/>oh, and amherst + williams are both mentioned in this novel. and amherst street in india is the third such street i've now seen, after its counterparts in cambridge and stanford. very cool, jhumpa lahiri.<br/><br/>today, this book could not have received the immensely positive fanfare à la the mid-aughts. in my mind, it is (perhaps unfairly) grouped in the same category as the kite runner or a thousand splendid suns. back in the day, americans might have found it sorta quirky to see how these ""others"" lived, especially when written beautifully. in the modern western immigration climate, i'm not so sure this is the case anymore.",,,1,0
