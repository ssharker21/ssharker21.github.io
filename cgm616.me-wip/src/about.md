My name is Cole Graber-Mitchell. I now live in Oregon, but I grew up in Minneapolis, went to college in Massachusetts, and just finished two years of graduate school in London. I believe that living better, more joyful lives is possible, but only if we work together to change our society. Through organizing and advocacy, I work on that change.

My activism and research has run the gamut. I've written about the death penalty, organized on a state attorney general campaign, knocked doors to talk about climate change, helped make local art more accessible, worked at polling places, and studied the intersection of law and religion. I've come to see it all as connected: each issue makes up some part of every other issue. Most importantly, I see these issues as *social* problems that require social and not technical solutions.
