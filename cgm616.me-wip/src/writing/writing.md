title: Read my informal writing
---

Writing helps me think. But without somewhere to put my writing, I don't end up writing anything at all. Here, you can read some of my thoughts: the informal writing I haven't published elsewhere. You could call it a blog.

> My academic writing is on my [research page](/research/) and my writing from undergrad is in the archives of [*The Amherst Student*](https://amherststudent.com/).
