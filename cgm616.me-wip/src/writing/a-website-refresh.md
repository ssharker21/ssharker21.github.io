I last updated the look and feel of my website in 2017, and it showed. The limited content on it was up-to-date, but the entire site represented an older version of me. Welcome to the first blog post on a freshly designed (from scratch) website that much better reflects who I am today.

<!-- excerpt -->

## Why this website?

I've had a web presence for a long time, but I've never done much with it. Occasionally my website would have blog posts on it, but I always deleted these eventually. My website's most meaningful use was to showcase my academic work, which it [still does](/research/).

However, since moving to Mastodon from Twitter a little while ago, I've read a lot more about what folks are calling the ["indie web."](https://indieweb.org/) The idea is that the web used to be inherently ideosyncratic. People hosted their own, weird little blogs and put their musings there. As social media became more dominant, it became much easier to post on Facebook or Twitter or Instagram instead of a personal blog, so most people switched to those platforms — giving those platforms, and their walled gardens, control over their content and data.

Social media made it easier for non-technical people to find and build community online, but it also limits our choices and profits off our personal data in ways that I find disturbing and dystopian. Increasingly, our contributions to the internet are instead contributions to corporations' mega-sites, locked behind paywalls and sited next to ads sold to the highest bidders. When we add content to StackExchange or Reddit or Instagram, we 1) lose control of it and 2) give these companies our contributions for free.^[Our contributions translate directly into money. Nobody would use Instagram, and therefore nobody would see its incessant ads, if it wasn't one of the only ways to keep up with and interact with friends.]

The solution is to ["rewild" the web](https://www.noemamag.com/we-need-to-rewild-the-internet/). This means many things at many levels of internet infrastructure, including moving our contributions on the web from privately-owned services to open networks where we have control over our content and data.

This can mean switching to federated services, like Mastodon instead of Twitter. But at a much-simpler level of technology, we can also just use *websites*. Anyone can visit this website and it won't track them. To share my content, I can send a link around. And no matter what, I have permanent, total control over my data. If I want to remove or edit a post, I can.^[I also don't need to deal with spam or harassment, since there's no way for other people to put anything of their own on my website. If people end up [emailing me](/contact/) hate — not exactly something I expect — I can deactivate that alias email.]

That's what **cgm616.me** is: a place to put my contributions to the web without enriching some of the worst people in the world. 

## The redesign

Before this redesign, my website looked like this:

{% image src="src/assets/images/old-website.png", alt="An outdated, ugly website, with ASCII art for the header.", caption="My website homepage from 2017 to 2024.", title="The content is updated; the look is not." %}

I designed it when I was 17 and it didn't fit me very well anymore. I decided to dust off my HTML and CSS skills — no JS in this website — and see if I could do better.

To be honest, I'm not sure how I feel about the new design. I like parts, but I think it lacks a cohesive feel. I collected inspiration from around the web and the physical world, but I didn't spend a huge amount of time trying new ideas and turning those inspirations into mock-ups that would work for me. Instead, I cobbled together different parts that I liked from other people's websites in order to get a usable minimum. Hopefully, once I'm done with my current master's dissertation, I'll have time to return to the design and think about it more carefully.

For now, it works. I have a website that I don't cringe to look at — a website I can put on my resumé without fear. And crucially, I have a place to begin writing again. I wrote a biweekly column all through undergrad, but haven't written much since. Now that I have a place to put my writing, I want that to change.
