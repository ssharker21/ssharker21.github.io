My name is Summit Sarkar.

I'm an undergraduate student at Amherst College, studying Economics & Law, Jurisprudence, and Social Thought.
I'm originally from Queens, NY but later moved to Ellicott City, MD.

I'm interested in domestic and foreign policy; my hobbies include reading great literature and following sports including Formula1, soccer, and college football.

Right now, I'm analyzing the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as a Forge Fellow at the Roosevelt Network. In addition, I am a Teaching Assistant for ECON-300: Microeconomics and an Articles Editor for the [Amherst College Law Review](https://amherstlawreview.wordpress.com/).

This summer, I worked at the [Center for Individual Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Individual_Rights), publishing research concerning Constitutional Law.
