My name is Cole Graber-Mitchell (cgm616).

I'm a postgraduate student in the College of Law at SOAS, University of London.
Last year, I studied Anthropology at the London School of Economics, and before that I graduated from Amherst College in Massachusetts.
I'm originally from Minneapolis, Minnesota.

I'm interested in progressive organizing and academics; I also like to dabble in
programming, block printing, singing, and guitar.

Right now, I'm thinking most about what I've come to term "climate humanities":
theoretical and practical work—in the arts, academia, politics, and
elsewhere—towards building a society that can weather the climate crisis.
