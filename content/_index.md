My name is Summit Sarkar.

I'm a junior in college at the moment.

I'm trying to be more conscious about the time I spend online. This website will be the one-stop shop for many things about me.

To see my historical commitments, go to [my history page](/history).
To see my academic work, go to [my research page](/research).
I also have a [blog](/blog) and a page for my [photographs](/photographs).
