My name is Summit Sarkar.

I've studied Economics at Amherst College and PPE at the University of Oxford.

I'm interested in domestic and foreign policy; my hobbies include reading great literature and following sports across the world.

Most recently, I've work as an Undergraduate Legal Intern at the [Competitive Enterprise Institute](https://cei.org/) and a Research Associate at [The Federalist Society](https://fedsoc.org/).

Formerly, I worked at the [Center for Individual Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Individual_Rights), conducting research concerning Constitutional Law.

At Amherst, I've held various teaching and research assistant positions across economics and international relations. I also serve as an Articles Editor at the [Amherst College Law Review](https://amherstlawreview.wordpress.com/).
