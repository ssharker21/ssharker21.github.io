I was extremely isolated at Amherst. Only now have I internalized the fundamental flaws of that lifestyle. It wasn't right to haunt the Science Center at 2 AM on Saturday mornings, unhappy and paralyzed by work, sitting and hurting in front of a screen. It wasn't right to deceive myself, pretending that stress and loneliness were requirements for a greater future. I coped and I coped: I overslept and woke up at ungodly hours, I skipped meals, I was afraid to be seen. Sometimes, I wonder if my roommate was ever concerned. Likewise for my parents: were they ever worried, or did they simply chalk it off as the normal me?[^1] Regardless, having nobody to think and grow with must have stunted my psyche, and only belatedly have I made some reversals this academic year. Nonetheless, I'm not a victim. Much of my pain was self-imposed, and I wouldn't go so far as to say that I made the wrong choice by coming to Amherst. Even though I couldn't find my people, the academics were still elite.

Speaking of academics, the Cold War ended due to a number of factors. The Soviet economy was flagging, the United States applied some pressure, etc. But there was exactly one reason fundamental to its conclusion–one factor that cannot be debated away. Gorbachev. At Oxford, my Gorbachev has been my friends. Indeed, there are other minor stimulants for my new lease on life: rewarding classes, an extraordinary city environment, cross-country running, [NHS CBT](https://www.nhs.uk/tests-and-treatments/cognitive-behavioural-therapy-cbt/), and the underrated English climate. But just as neither the economy nor Reagan *forced* the USSR to change, the other factors without the "f-word" would otherwise amount to little positive change in my life.

By being sick, one more truly appreciates, health, etc. etc. This holds equally true with loneliness and friendships. Knowing how I used to be, I've made real effort to be *good* around my friends. I try to be a good listener, for they have really valuable things to say–they know things that I don't, and they think differently, too. I try to sacrifice for them–e.g., staying up late for no reason but to be present (the opposite of CBT's prescription), skipping a concert to ensure that their short film production isn't derailed. But counterintuitively, it's been working! Over the months, I've been able to discern what virtues they possess, ones that I so acutely lack. You might think I'm undeservingly pedestalizing my friends–surely low self-esteem might be biasing my assessment? Certainly, this is within the realm of possibility. My friends aren't exactly saints–there have been growing pains.

Is sharpness a virtue? All of my friends are wicked sharp. The other PPEists are wittier than I am. And hard work is virtuous too–my Physicist friends work very, very hard.[^2] Nor are my friends unkind. I think they are *cool*. My friends dream so big, and for some reason, that makes me feel less small. One friend wants to make it in the film industry, and another hopes to study at CERN. Even Jane Street is worth something. I see how hard they push everyday to achieve these dreams, and they also possess the requisite talent for a fighting chance. I hope they never let it go.

My friends are optimistic, and after spending time with them, I've noticed how it rubs off on me too. They're also better with their identities, at more mature points in their journeys than I am. It's not right to be as ashamed as I was. Furthermore, I don't feel constrained around my friends. I can say things and ask questions without the fear of being pushed away. And though they have what I don't have, that has never provoked my envy. Unbeknownst to them, my friends are really walking around with a stock of public goods that I can absorb at no cost of their own.

Nonetheless, I'm constantly fraught with this hopelessness and fear–I don't want to be *bad again* once I'm out of Oxford, though I can already see this tragic inevitability unfolding. Even though I was taught to quit catastrophizing from CBT, some things still feel imminent.  Earlier, I mentioned that when people leave, all you're left is [how they changed you](https://summitsarkar.com/blog/2025/12/reinvention/). I'm begging for this intrinsic change to gain permanence, for I am so proud of how I've become better. Nobody else really knows about the new me, because they aren't me. But *I* know how precious this has all been.[^3]

Last Tuesday, I had the privilege of listening to this incredible Political Theory lecture from Prof. [Teresa Bejan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teresa_Bejan), on small-c conservatism. 

Mentioned in passing was a Michael Oakeshott quote:
> "Friends are not concerned with what might be made of one another, but only with the enjoyment of one another; and the condition of this enjoyment is a ready acceptance of what is and the absence of any desire to change or to improve. A friend is not somebody one trusts to behave in a certain manner, who supplies certain wants, who has certain useful abilities, who possesses certain merely agreeable qualities, or who holds certain acceptable opinions; he is somebody who engages the imagination, who excites contemplation, who provokes interest, sympathy, delight and loyalty simply on account of the relationship entered into."

I am really growing to resonate with this quote in a way I never did before.

Finally, I would be remiss if I ignored the other kind of friend–the one that primarily sustains rather than transforms. Being sustained is so important–otherwise the peaks and the troughs of daily life are almost unbearable. I am equally grateful for these people, because maybe they transform me in subtler increments over the years, beyond my straightforward recognition. 

Indeed, these friends reflect my [conservatism](https://wp.aleteia.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/02/on_being_conservative.pdf):
> "the familiar to the unknown, to prefer the tried to the untried, fact to mystery, the actual to the possible, the limited to the unbounded, the near to the distant, the sufficient to the superabundant, the convenient to the perfect, present laughter to utopian bliss."

So far, I've found that transformation and permanence are mutually exclusive–the only people who have deeply changed me are also never around for long. Supposedly, there exist [Alices](https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/looking-for-alice) in this world, but I'll believe it when I see it. Until then, I'll remain content with what I have.

[^1]: I don't make it easy for them: being distant and a little hostile, unable to divulge even the slightest bits of my life.
[^2]: Needless to say, they are also brighter than I am.
[^3]: In part, I'm writing all of this to assure future me that I really felt this way–that this wasn't merely a trick of my imagination.
