# Small Intro

## How I got here

My site is mostly a product of an Amherst alum's work. Some time ago, I stumbled upon Cole Graber-Mitchell ('22) on LinkedIn. His *old* website was attractively minimal without seeming Weebly/Wordpress-like. After cloning his Github repository, I spent a fair chunk of time modifying it for my use. Before, I did so manually (with my beginner's coding knowledge), and recently, I've offloaded this work to Cursor/Antigravity. On CGM's *new* site, he has a requirement to not train AI on his work. And I haven't, by disabling telemetry and all.

## What I've done so far

- Uploaded some of my schoolwork and projects from my formal employment.
- Minimally documented places I've studied and worked.

## Why I'm here

I've permanently deleted both of my Instagram accounts. I've been LinkedIn-free for some time too. I try to make an effort to spend my time online more purposefully these days, though that doesn't always end up happening. I've spent more and more time reading old blogs and stalking personal websites from random Twitter users.

## Future website plans

- Blog more. Hopefully a good amount of longer-form works.
    - I plan on reflecting on past events and thinking about the future, too.
- Upload important things:
    - I have some cherished multimedia from my days of Instagram, especially from my "finsta."
    - Make something like Goodreads locally. Maybe 200-300 books from there.
    - I got a different camera after my old Sony RX-100 Mark I broke. I need a reason to use my Fujifilm X-Pro 1 more when the academic term cools down. I'll upload some photographs here.
