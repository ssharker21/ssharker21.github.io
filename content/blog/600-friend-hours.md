### Setup

I place a very heavy premium on lengthy friendships. Presumably, this bias inhibits me from making new friends. Alas, I don't do superficial. So allow me to present an arbitrary criterion for close friendships: I talked to them at least weekly (almost always exceeding this threshold) for at least 40 weeks in 2025.

Only six individuals meet this criterion, and I've known them for 20, 9, 9, 6, 5, and 4 years, respectively. The graveyard of my former close friendships is also littered with similarly lengthy tenures, each 4-8 years long.

This winter break at Oxford, I had the extraordinary privilege of sharing 600 friend-hours between K (see above, at 5 years) and Z (at 4 years): a split of 425 hours with K and 175 hours with Z. This opportunity was extraordinary for multiple reasons. First, I am certain that this is the penultimate or final time we will be on a prolonged vacation together. (Future potential weddings don't count. They will operate under a whole different set of circumstances; they won't be vacations.) Our larger set of shared (present and former) acquaintances and friends–those we went on vacations with in the past–don't seem eager to repeat our past forays. Nor do I blame them; many of us have grown up, and we find it difficult to share that same past connection, though we blame it on misaligned, jam-packed schedules. 

Second, we traveled _internationally_ for the first time. My three other group trips, with a subset of former and present close friends, have all been across the East Coast, seeing only a few cities at most. This time, we saw a staggering _twelve_ (or fourteen, including small towns), making the trip extremely grueling at times. Finally, the length was substantial: K was around me at all times of day and night, for 18 days. Yet, I felt a sense of melancholy pervading the entire trip, because though these are two of the last friends I have, I feel that our best days together are inevitably in the rearview mirror. So, I was very grateful for one final hurrah.

### England, Pt. 1

Our first few days at Oxford were great. The highlight was our very first, but certainly not last, trip to Wetherspoon (colloquially referred to as Spoons). I can say with great conviction that this restaurant/pub chain is the greatest establishment remaining in the United Kingdom. On other days, we had memorable times in the New College JCR, staying warm and playing billiards. We drank 54% dark chocolate hot cocoa at Knoops–heaven in liquid form. I showed K and Z my two favorite kebab carts in the city. We went to my favorite pub, Lamb & Flag.

Bath was pretty enough. I mindlessly meandered along the banks of the Avon alone, snapping photographs with my Fujifilm camera while K and Z visited the Roman Baths. Bristol was eye-opening–my first experience of a decaying industrial English port city. But the Uni of Bristol was beautiful to walk through at dusk, and the city museum punched above its weight. Bristol had an authentically gritty nature, and I understand why the city remains a bastion of underground culture today.

I miss the train rides we took together. The trains were so speedy and comfortable–riding Amtrak will never feel the same again. The expansive windows allowed full view of the English countryside hurtling by. The grass was so vividly green, with sheep dotting the landscape. Picturesque country estates loomed in the distance, surely worth millions of quid.

The £4 Greggs coffees and sausage bakes jump-started our foggy brains on the morning train before we eavesdropped on the outlandish conversations of our raucously drunk neighbors on their midday benders on the Great Western. It was our barely concealed, shaking laughter that *kept* us awake. Later, our neighbors' crumpled Stellas left behind served as a persistent reminder of what we witnessed as we passed one town after another.

### Britain's Lessons

London was fine; West London in particular was excellent. Our 21-mile-walk-day holds a special place in my heart, with half of the mileage coming from wandering around Fulham and Chelsea after dark. The chants at the Fulham home game at Craven Cottage, our rapid pace to combat the wind chill, and the obligatory late-night stop at Spoons were all so special. And there, meeting a random disillusioned young adult, spontaneously Ubering to his house, and talking to his old, important ex-financier dad (who has a Wikipedia page) about the economic and political state of the world was a first for me. It's the kind of experience you can only have as an unemployed young adult.

As to the international component of the trip, we took these awful pre-dawn EasyJet and Ryanair flights on 4-5 hours of sleep. Taking a shuttle to the airport entailed waking up at 3am multiple times–the things one must do as a poor college student. Having some miserable hostel experiences (sketchy guests, frightening odors, etc.) on top of insufficient, uncomfortable sleep definitely contributed to our irritable moods at times. And I made two substantial mistakes this trip: 1) I forsook my thicker jacket to look more fashionable, ending up shivering from the chill (in Scotland, particularly); 2) my only bag (read: "personal item") was this tiny, fraying, and thinly-strapped Fjällräven Kånken bag, which meant I could hardly carry any clothes at all. I had to wear one pair of pants for nine whole days, in bed and outside. The straps also bit into my shoulder blades, and I often ended up carrying my bag instead of letting my back suffer. I have taken away so much from these lessons, and I will be in substantially better shape for my next international trip.

In Scotland, I came down with the common cold. It made the trip more difficult than I expected. My nose was red, with my skin tender and flaking off. Even without my illness, Edinburgh was a real shock. After five years of pedestalizing the city for its dark academia vibe, I suffered a "Paris Syndrome" of sorts as the experience fell horribly short. The city was dirty, crowded, and unsafe. Next, we traveled to Glasgow at dawn on Christmas Day. Everything was shuttered–nobody good was outside. The city felt eerie and dystopian. In contrast, St. Andrews was quaint with only posh tourists, so we probably stuck out negatively. Perhaps _we_ were the "nobody good" outside. Dundee, on the other hand, was this very gritty town à la Bristol, and the view on the 1.4-mile Tay Road Bridge into the city was gorgeous. I liked it.

### Ireland & England Pt. 2

While rushing to catch our 3:40am bus shuttle to our flight out of EDI, I yelped as I slipped and fell back-first onto the slick, uneven cobblestone road descending from Old Town; thankfully, I was only slightly injured. So, I flew into Belfast with low expectations: sick, sleepy, shivering, and hurt. Nonetheless, the city exceeded expectations. We must have walked nearly 15 miles all across town. We had to close the evening with some wings at Spoons, watching the heartbreaking Chelsea-Aston Villa game on K's phone, before we headed on a train to Dublin.

James Joyce's city was alright: Trinity College Dublin was pretty, but our hostel left much to be desired. We then headed to Leeds, home to the only Chick-fil-A in Britain. The prices were exorbitant, but I tasted home for the first time in forever. We then spent the next two days in York. The city was quaint, and we went out with some fellow travelers we met at our hostel's cozy common room: we played some billiards and I received some local, underground music recommendations from a Brit. The next day, I had this awful stomach bug–I must have vomited four times across a few hours after holding back my puke for much of the day. Regrettably, I couldn't enjoy anything we did, including a really nice train museum.

During one of the puking instances, I was conscious enough to rush, just in time, to the nearest grate on the road before unleashing the stream. A long line of drivers, bemused and repulsed, stopped at the traffic light watching me puke. I was too nauseous to care at the time, but it makes me blush thinking about it now–I wonder if this will tip them towards voting Reform. I eventually felt better as I closed out the evening with a burger and hot chocolate from the York Spoons, reading an ebook on my phone alone before catching the high-speed CrossCountry back to London. We then walked from King's Cross to Marylebone, making our connection to Oxford.

### The End

The remaining days were less eventful. We spent much of our time sleeping in, lying in bed scrolling, and watching football. We were forced under blankets and sleeping bags, and we loitered near the kitchen oven and took lengthy, hot showers, for my radiator had completely stopped working. Inconveniently, there was no solace as the college technicians were MIA for winter break. 

And unfortunately, New College was locked up, so there was neither the JCR-relaxing as before nor the library-studying as promised. We day-tripped to the Cotswolds, which was a bit underwhelming since we lacked a car. We attempted thrifting in Cowley but came up short, and we tried going out but found Oxford mostly dead in the new year without students. We ate at a Chinese restaurant back in town with a friend from Notre Dame. (The food was excellent for the price.) K and I returned to Lamb & Flag one final time for good measure. Then, we finally parted ways.

In the first few days following K's departure, my room felt so empty and quiet–I had almost forgotten what being alone felt like. I'm really glad I took so much away from these experiences, something I promised myself I would strive for in a previous blog post. I hope that I'm refreshed and ready to tackle Hilary Term at full capacity.

### Appendix

**Hostel Notes:**

1. **Castle Rock Hostel (Edinburgh)**, 9.5/10. Never been to a better hostel. Full-fledged industrial-grade kitchen and eating area, filled with conversations around us. Overheard American accents, Indian accents, and everything in between. The bedrooms were cozy, with really thoughtful design and art. The common area was lively and there was a pool table. The building itself is really like a castle, with all sorts of corridors leading everywhere across the six (?) stories.
2. **Astor York** - 7.5/10. Fairly barebones sleeping facilities, but excellent social amenities. 1) A very cozy, carpeted lounge with sofas, a Christmas tree, a piano, and a bookshelf with some literature actually worth reading (i.e., _Six of Crows_). 2) A clean, modern kitchen. More of a home vibe than an industrial one. 3) A connecting dining area to the kitchen with various tables and chairs. 4) A bar.
3. **Abbey Court Dublin** - 5.5/10. Really sketchy people in our 32-bed room. Dublin hostels are also just expensive in general. The building was also sinister. Frightening odor. Only redeeming feature was a rather lively basement where young adults were actually talking to one another. Part of the basement was closed off for renovation (game room) and the bar was shut.
4. **St Christopher's Inn Edinburgh - Original** - 5/10. Bad vibes. Though it was super close to the train station, there wasn't much mingling or a social atmosphere. At least the beds had curtains. Some guy in our room spoke on his phone all night and moaned in the morning as he brushed his teeth. Very weird. Also, bad etiquette from our neighbors in the room who spoke loudly, turned on the main light, and slammed doors at 11pm.

**Spoons:**
1. **Oxford** - The Four Candles
2. **Fulham** - Walham Green
3. **Belfast** - The Bridge House
4. **York** - The Punch Bowl
