title: About this website
---

I made this website with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) and it is hosted on Github Pages. You can read its [source code on GitHub](https://github.com/cgm616/cgm616.me). The site is mostly hand-rolled HTML and CSS with some Eleventy plugins and custom logic for various visual adornments, such as margin notes.

The primary typeface for body and display text is the variable font [Literata](https://www.type-together.com/literata-font) designed by TypeTogether. Some elements are set in [Public Sans](https://public-sans.digital.gov/) designed by the General Services Administration of the US government.

I have not and will not use "AI" to generate any content on this website, such as text or images. 


## Colophons

![A colophon from an illuminated manuscript of the Shahnameh made c. 1648 and presented to Queen Victoria of England in 1839. Now held by the [Royal Collection Trust](https://www.rct.uk/collection/1005014/shahnamah-shhnmh-the-book-of-kings).](/assets/images/colophon/colophon2.jpg){ .margin style="height: 300px; width: auto" alt="A beautiful page from a book. The inside has rows of Arabic script in black in in an inverted pyramid, wide at the top and getting steadily thinner until barely a character across at the bottom. The writing is surrounded by gold tree motifs and a thick gold border at the edge of the page." }

Old manuscripts often have [colophons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colophon_(publishing)) with information about their construction, such as the place, calligrapher, illustrator, and date. Books still often have this: the copyright page usually details the publisher and the book's edition. Sometimes the typeface is listed too.

A colophon brings the process of making into a finished product. I think this is especially important nowadays. It can easily feel like everything around us is the product of some impossibly-complicated production chain that we have no hope of understanding, much less influencing. This feeling of helplessness helps some—those who take profit and power from their control over modern technology, for instance—and hurts the rest of us. This colophon is an invitation to see that the internet is not so complicated of a place. Even those of us with human-scale resources can have a personal website.

If you're interested in building your own website, feel free to take a look at the tools I used above. They're perfect for someone with some prior knowledge of website design. If you have no experience with HTML, CSS, or Javascript, then check out the [Getting Started](https://indieweb.org/Getting_Started#IndieWeb_Services) guide on IndieWebCamp. There are plenty of tools to help everyone control their own internet presence.
